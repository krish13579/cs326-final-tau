**Innovative Idea:**
General:
Do you not have a car and want to go to Boston for the weekend? Are you driving to Boston and having an extra seat? Let us match you and provide an easy one-stop solution to ride shares to and from western Massachusetts. 

(**Current Solution:**) 
Currently, you have to go through a Facebook group and constantly check, refresh, and coordinate one on one with the riders and drivers. The market for this problem already exists because the transportation from UMass to nearby cities is scarce. 

(**Proposed Solution:**) 
There will be 2 interfaces-
A rider
A driver
Car providers can input the days and times they will be travelling to a particular location (Like Boston) and the pickup range around where they live. They set a price per seat of their car based on their needs and submit the event. They can also look through an existing list of ride requests users have made to pick up any pre-existing requests. They can select a rider and message them to connect.
On the rider side the event shows up and they have a filter to look for events that match their needs. If a pre-existing event and driver doesnâ€™t match their needs, they can add their request to the system with their criteria. If they see a driver in the list that they see fit, they can message them. Upon receiving a message from either party, the match can move forward with ironing out details.
These locations could stretch from on-campus points of interest to near by cities like Boston.

**Important Components:**
Streamlined Messaging Platform:
Allow users to speak with each other before agreeing to a rideshare to make sure they feel comfortable with each other. This helps protect your contact information from potentially suspicious users. It also provides a level of safety where users can ask questions and conduct due diligence. Also allows people to share additional information about the ride. 

**Event Setting:**
Drivers can set up various different kinds of events, From rides to boston during the day to even night time rides to certain events, allowing potential users to waive high charge uber and lyft costs and an easier ride back to campus. Once events are created and published they will show up on the rider end of the website and will be grouped into various categories such as time, location, and date allowing riders to look at potential matches and maybe even come up with new plans that match these rides. Providing a streamlined process for looking at events and making matches. 

**Requests:**
If a user doesn't find an event that suits them, there will be a form they can fill out to set up a request to be placed in a list that will be available to drivers to choose from. 


(**Filtering:**) 
After selecting the event they prefer, users can filter drivers by location, gender, school year, seats available, and car type. For example, if a student has luggage to take to Boston airport, the user can filter drivers with SUVs to help streamline the search process. They can filter based on a certain gender and age to ensure a more secure aspect for some riders.
